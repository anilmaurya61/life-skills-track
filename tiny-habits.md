Creating a new habit is tough and doesn't happen overnight. But if you start with small steps and keep doing them consistently for a long time, it becomes a regular part of your daily routine without it feeling hard.

## Question 2

**How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?**

To make forming new habits easier using "B = MAP":

- B (Behavior): Define the specific habit you want to establish.
