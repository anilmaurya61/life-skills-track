# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

**Question 1: What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?**

1. Inappropriate touching
2. Sexual comments or jokes
3. Making inappropriate comments
4. Sending explicit pictures
5. Secretly watching

**Question 2: What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?**

If I see someone doing something wrong, I would try to help if it's safe. I might talk to the person and tell them I'm uncomfortable or worried. If it continues or is dangerous, I would call the police or get help from others.
